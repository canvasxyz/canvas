# @canvas-js/replication-server

The universal replication server discovers peers through a discovery topic, and replicates all peers that announce their application on that topic, without validating or executing actions.

## Usage

```
npm run start
```

or

```
PEER_ID=... npm run start
```

Configure the replication server using environment variables:

- DISCOVERY_TOPIC: A discovery topic to serve, by default `canvas-discovery`.
- LISTEN: An interface to listen on, by default `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080/ws`.
- PEER_ID: A fixed peer ID, which you can generate using `./create-peer-id.js`. Otherwise a random one will be generated.
- ANNOUNCE: An address to announce on.
- BOOTSTRAP_LIST: A list of multiaddrs to use as a bootstrap list.
- DATA_DIRECTORY: A directory to store applications' data.

```

## Troubleshooting

To connect to a running replication server, you can use the Fly console, e.g.:

```
fly ssh console --app=canvas-chat-discovery-p0
```

Then, you can install sqlite:

```
apt update
apt install sqlite3
sqlite3 data/my-example-app/db.sqlite
```
