# Networking

For browser-first applications, we provide APIs for checking the connectivity and online status
of other users connected to your app.

## Checking online status

For connectivity status, check `app.status` to see if you're online.

The app's status will show `connected` as soon as libp2p has a connection to at least one peer running the
same application on the network.

You can listen to the `connections:updated` event to keep track of a list of connections:

```ts{7}
import { useCanvas } from "@canvas-js/hooks"
import type { Connections } from "@canvas-js/core"

const { app } = useCanvas({ topic: "...", contract: "..." })

useEffect(() => {
  app?.addEventListener("connections:updated", ({ detail: { connections } }) => {
    console.log(app?.status)
    // 'connected'

    console.log(connections)
    // [{
    //   12D3KooWQW2V7moLojFaScKMza3mMqrvvQm9cEgwgyRnr271Z4tX: {
    //     connections: [ConnectionImpl],
    //     peer: Ed25519PeerIdImpl,
    //     status: "online"
    //   }
    // }]
  })
}, [app])
```

The `connections` object lists peers that you are directly connected to.

Peers that are actively sending and receiving actions for the application will be shown as `online` (🟢). Peers passively participating in the mesh will be `waiting` (⚪️), those still connecting will be `connecting` (🟡), and unresponsive peers will be shown as `disconnected` (🔴).

As long as at least one peer is `online`, your application will show as connected. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/blob/main/examples/chat/src/ConnectionStatus.tsx#L129).

## Configuring realtime presence

By default, libp2p doesn't maintain connections to every other peer running your application
at the same time, since this could be hundreds of peers or more.

Instead, we maintain a libp2p discovery/presence service, which tracks peers that you aren't
directly connected to.

To use this service, set a `discoveryTopic` in your application configuration:

```ts{7}
const { app } = useCanvas({
  topic: "my-app-room-x",
  contract: {
    // models: ...
    // actions: ...
  },
  discoveryTopic: 'my-app-discovery',
})
```

The **discovery topic** is separate from your **application topic**. Discovery topics are used
to coordinate presence and peer discovery across people running many different applications -
each application can be a different contract, or a copy of the same contract.

You can use this to implement sharded applications, where someone can move between different
rooms as they use the application, and each room will sync separately. (For applications with
just one partition, you can configure the discovery topic to the same as the contract topic.)

With `discoveryTopic` configured, your applications will automatically broadcast presence events.
Listen for the `presence:join` and `presence:leave` events to see when peers join:

```ts{16}
const handlePresenceListUpdated = ({ detail: { peerId, peers } }) => {
  console.log(peerId)
  // '12D3KooWCQQz7uozb287GZCRGv7DrrZTVDuUfh2bNCd3rpUHgpes'

  console.log(peers)
  // {
  //   12D3KooWCQQz7uozb287GZCRGv7DrrZTVDuUfh2bNCd3rpUHgpes: {
  //     address: null,
  //     env: "server",
  //     lastSeen: 1703317637626,
  //     topics: ["my-app-room-1"]
  // }
}

useEffect(() => {
  app?.addEventListener("presence:join", handlePresenceListUpdated)
  return () => app?.removeEventListener("presence:join", handlePresenceListUpdated)
})
```

Join events will be triggered whenever someone new joins the network, and leave events
will be triggered after that peer goes offline, after about a minute of inactivity.

You can configure the threshold by setting `presenceTimeout` in your app config.
(see an example [here](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/blob/main/examples/chat/src/App.tsx#L45)).

## Listing online peers

The event also provides a `peers` list, which shows a list of online peers:

- `address` is the public address of the user behind this online peer. For an Ethereum signer,
  this will be a did:pkh prefixed blockchain address in the form `did:pkh:eip155:1:0xabc`.
  Note that this address is self-attested and not cryptographically verified (yet).
- `env` is the environment that peer is running in, either `browser` or `server`.
- `lastSeen` is the milliseconds since the last heartbeat from this peer.
- `topics` is the list of topics the peer is subscribed to.

To get a list of other online users, filter the list of peers down to those where
`peer.env === 'browser'`.

To only show peers when they have proactively sent a heartbeat, filter the list with
`peer.lastSeen !== null`. This will cause your list of online peers to fill from scratch
when you start the application. (By default, we try to load peers from other peers'
presence cache, so that you can see a list of recently active peers immediately.)

## Listing online peers across applications

To track presence status across apps on a discovery topic, configure the application
with `trackAllPeers: true`.

```ts{8}
const { app } = useCanvas({
  topic: "my-app-room-x",
  contract: {
    // models: ...
    // actions: ...
  },
  discoveryTopic: 'my-app-discovery',
  trackAllPeers: true,
})
```

This will cause `presence:join` events to be emitted for all peers that join the discovery
topic, even if they have a different app topic. Check the event's `topics` list to see
which application(s) the peer is running.

You can also see this on our [chat app](https://chat-example.canvas.xyz/). Try opening a few
rooms on [this client](https://mud-example.vercel.app/), and those rooms will show up in the
chat app's presence list.

For more details, the main chat app's source code is [here](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/blob/main/examples/chat),
while the multi-room client's source is [here](https://github.com/canvasxyz/mud-example).
