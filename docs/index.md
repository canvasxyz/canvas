<TextRow title="How it Works">
  <TextItem>Canvas allows you to write realtime multiplayer applications, by expressing the core logic of your application as a set of functions running over libp2p.</TextItem>
  <TextItem>User interactions are signed using a blockchain address or DID, relayed over libp2p, and executed in a CRDT VM that transparently merges actions from different users.</TextItem>

```tsx:Messaging preview
const models = {
	messages: {
		id: "primary",
		message: "string",
		timestamp: "integer",
		$indexes: [["timestamp"]],
	}
}

const actions = {
	send: (db, { message }, { address, timestamp, id }) => {
		if (!message || !message.trim()) throw new Error()
		db.set("messages", { id, message, timestamp })
	}
}

// Use the application in React
const { app } = useCanvas({
	contract: { models, actions },
	topic: "canvas-example-public-chat"
})
const messages = useLiveQuery(app, "messages", { limit: 10 })
return <div>{messages.map((message) => { ... })}</div>
```

```tsx:Game preview
const models = {
  boards: {
    id: "primary",
    position: "string",
  },
}

const actions = {
  move: async (db, { from, to }, { address, timestamp, id }) => {
    const board = await db.get("boards", "<gameid>")
    const chess = new Chess(board.position)
    const move = chess.move({ from, to, promotion: "q" })
    if (move === null) throw new Error("invalid")
    await db.set("boards", { id: "<gameid>", position: chess.fen() })
  },
  reset: async (db, {}, { address, timestamp, id }) => {
    await db.set("boards", { id: "<gameid>", fen: new Chess().fen() })
  }
}

// Use the application in React
const { app } = useCanvas({

<TextRow title="About Canvas">
  <TextItem>Canvas applications are defined as multiplayer contracts, which run on both the browser and server.</TextItem>
  <TextItem>User actions are relayed between everyone on the network, and executed by each client. They read and write from a multi-writer, <a href="https://crdt.tech" target="_blank">conflict-free</a> database, which allows interactions to be merged as they're received.</TextItem>
  <TextItem>This means that unlike blockchains, interactions on Canvas applications sync instantly, without tokens or gas limits.</TextItem>
  <TextItem>They can also call outside code, fetch external data, or process data that would be difficult or unwieldy to put onchain.</TextItem>
  <TextItem>Today, you can use Canvas as a peer-to-peer network with persistent state, for applications like chat, games, governance, and decentralized compute. Or, if you add a data availability service, you can also use it as a full-fledged decentralized apps platform.</TextItem>
