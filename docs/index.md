<TextRow title="About Canvas">
  <TextItem prefix="Fast">Actions are processed as soon as they're seen.</TextItem>
  <TextItem prefix="Optimistic">Actions can arrive out-of-order, but CRDTs and distributed server reconciliation are used to resolve differences.</TextItem>
  <TextItem prefix="Client-first">The entire state of each application is stored inside the browser. Applications can be partitioned so clients only sync the data they're interested in.</TextItem>
  <TextItem prefix="Server-enabled">We provide a CLI for running Canvas applications on the server, and are working on a hosting service.</TextItem>
  <TextItem prefix="Encryption-enabled">You can use helpers to generate private keys, encrypt clients' data, and use zk-proving and verification.</TextItem>
  <TextItem prefix="Bring your own finality">The default engine doesn't implement any finality mechanisms, but you can bring your own by adding a timestamping or DA layer.</TextItem>
