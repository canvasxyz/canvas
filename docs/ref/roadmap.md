# Roadmap

_This page lists the upcoming priorities that we're working on right now.
For past release notes, please see [Github](https://github.com/canvasxyz/canvas/releases)._

## Upcoming Priorities

- **Improving the experience around upgrading applications.**
- **Improving the experience for hosting applications.**
- **Supporting the launch of the first protocolized applications on our system.** (by June 2025)
- Adding a non-Ethereum, conventional (web2-friendly) login method.
- Improving configurability around peer-to-peer networking, for
  e.g. applications that want to only sync with selected peers
  rather than connecting to the DHT.
- Support for application deployment on existing EVM chains.
- Support for sharding applications into multiple objects.
- Support for partial sync.
- Support for private data.

## 0.15 (Upcoming release)

This is a nonbreaking, backwards compatible change that adds two new syntaxes for
contracts: class contracts and model-only contracts.

- [ ] Add an API for defining applications as ES6 classes.
- [x] Add an API for defining application contracts/databases without actions,
  where permissions are defined in a `$rules` object, similar to Firebase permissions.
- [x] Add `db.create()` and `db.id()` methods for creating database records with
  autogenerated primary keys.
- [x] Add `db.merge()` and `db.update()` methods for partial updates.
  These are only available inside transactions at this time.

## 0.14 (2025-04-18)

This releases includes significant changes to the main application API
around how actions are defined. This is the first version where the main
application APIs can be considered stable.

- Add Farcaster login support, inside frames using miniapp login, and outside frames using SIWF.
- Add basic login components, including a sign in/sign out React button.
- Add transactions, using the `db.transaction()` method.
- Reworked APIs like `db.set()` from scratch following the addition of transactions.
- Changed action API syntax from `action(db, ...args)` to `action(...args)`.
