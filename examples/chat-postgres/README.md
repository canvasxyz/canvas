## Server-side chat with Postgres and NextJS

This app demonstrates how a hybrid client/server implementation of Canvas can work.

  1) All signer state is stored on the frontend. Only signatures and signed actions are passed to the server, which handles all other Canvas-related functionality
  2) Effects recieved on the server are persisted into a local or cloud Postgres database
  3) Integrates with NextJS's static generation and frontend tooling features

### Workspaces

This project uses NPM workspaces, and all commands are assumed to be executed in the root of the workspace. For commands specific to this chat project, use `-w` to specify the project name `@canvas-js/chat-postgres`

```
cd canvas/
npm run build
npm run build -w @canvas-js/chat-postgres
```

### Setup

You need a Postgres instance running locally or remotely that conforms to a standard `postgresql://` connection string. You can provide this string as a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, or configure a local instance using the following credential format:

```
"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/chat_postgres":
  user: postgres
  password: postgres
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  database_name: chat_postgres
```

- You need standard node and npm versions (node 18+)

### Run

To run, navigate to the root of the workspace and install dependencies:
  - `npm i`

Run the development server for compiling Canvas runtime files:
  - `npm run dev`

Finally, run the development server for this app:
  - `npm run dev -w @canvas-js/chat-postgres`

### Build

To deploy remotely, you need to run (2) build steps and (1) command to start the server.

Make sure you have a valid Postgres connection string passed as `DATABASE_URL`.

1) Build the core `canvas` files in the root repo:
  - `npm run build`
2) Build the NextJS-related files in the `chat-postgres` app:
  - `npm run build -w @canvas-js/chat-postgres`
3) Run the production server:
  - `npm run start -w @canvas-js/chat-postgres`
