Canvas is a platform for decentralized applications, where every user
interaction is a signed message distributed over a [peer-to-peer
network](https://libp2p.io/). User actions are [efficiently
sychronized](https://github.com/canvasxyz/okra) and merged using
[collaborative data types](https://crdt.tech/), making it possible
to build decentralized applications with near-realtime responsiveness
and no token transactions.

Compared to using libp2p directly, Canvas provides:

* persistence
* efficient sync for past actions
* a concise language for defining applications, and upgrading between different versions
* a SQL database and customizable view functions
* a set of hooks for reading from chains
* support for a wide range of cryptographies/signature formats

Canvas is designed to be maximally interoperable and data-agnostic. We
expect to support a wide range of signed data formats, plus the
ability to sync Canvas networks to non-blockchain data sources.

For more information, see the [Canvas documentation](https://docs.canvas.xyz).
